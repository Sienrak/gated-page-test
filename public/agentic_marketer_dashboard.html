                <h2>The Race to the Top: How Agentic Marketers Turn AI Productivity Into Brand Differentiation</h2>
                
                <p>For marketing leaders, the past year has felt like living in a pressure cooker. Between board expectations for instant AI transformation, the relentless pace of new tool launches, and the nagging worry that everyone using the same technology will make your brand sound generic, it's no wonder many CMOs are experiencing AI anxiety rather than AI excitement.</p>

                <blockquote>"That's not strategy," says Diego Lomanto, Chief Marketing Officer at Writer. "It's a race to the bottom."</blockquote>

                <p>But there's another path forward, one that leading marketing organizations at companies like KPMG, American Eagle, and Qualcomm are already proving works. It's called the agentic marketing engine, and it represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI's role in modern marketing.</p>

                <h3>The Strategic Choice Every CMO Faces</h3>

                <p>The marketing world stands at a crossroads. One path leads to a future flooded with derivative, reverse-engineered content that erodes customer trust and leads to long-term brand decay. The other path uses AI not as a replacement for creativity, but as a catalyst for it.</p>

                <blockquote>"The real question is no longer about what AI can do for us," Lomanto explains, "but what we as marketers are prepared to do with the freedom that it provides."</blockquote>

                <p>This isn't just philosophical posturing. Companies are already seeing the results of choosing one path over the other. The difference comes down to a simple but powerful framework: use AI to boost productivity, then funnel those gains into what truly sets you apart.</p>

                <h3>The Five-Pillar Marketing Engine</h3>

                <p>The agentic marketing engine operates on five interconnected pillars. The first two, speed and scale, drive productivity gains. The final three, humanity, high touch, and relevance, create brand differentiation. Together, they form a system that helps marketing organizations move faster while standing out more distinctly.</p>

                <h4>Speed: Closing the Gap Between Insight and Action</h4>

                <p>In today's market, speed has moved from nice-to-have to competitive necessity. An AI agent can take a single research report and automatically execute a dozen downstream tasks, from drafting summaries to creating social posts to updating sales decks.</p>

                <p>Consider this real-world example from KPMG: "One of my stakeholders reached out to me on a Wednesday morning and he was tasked to write an article for a publication," recalls a KPMG team member. "I was able to send him a draft of all of the answers to his questions within an hour. He thought it would take me all day long, which it probably would have had I not had Writer."</p>

                <p>That's the power of speed through AI. A task that could have consumed an entire workday now takes an hour, freeing up seven hours for higher-value strategic work.</p>

                <h4>Scale: From Six Photos to 500 Content Pieces</h4>

                <p>The volume demands of modern marketing would be impossible without AI assistance. As one American Eagle executive put it: "When I was at Calvin Klein, a campaign meant six beautiful pictures, a Soho billboard, a double page spread in Vogue, high five, and you move on to the next. Now at American Eagle, we're producing at least five hundred pieces of content a week."</p>

                <p>But it's not just about producing more content. With 34,000 SKUs on their website, American Eagle needed a way to handle product descriptions at scale while maintaining brand voice. The solution wasn't hiring hundreds of writers; it was using AI agents to replicate excellence across every touchpoint.</p>

                <h4>Humanity: Empowering Creative People</h4>

                <p>Here's where the equation shifts from productivity to differentiation. "In an AI world, we actually need more human creativity, not less," Lomanto emphasizes. "We need the rule breakers, the storytellers."</p>

                <p>By taking on the 80% of work that's repetitive and tactical, AI frees up your most valuable resource: your team's creative energy. This allows them to focus on the 20% that is strategic and inspired.</p>

                <blockquote>"Too many companies treat AI like just another tool for efficiency or for cost cutting. But if you don't see AI as a disruptor, you're really missing the true potential of it." - KPMG</blockquote>

                <p>The proof? "Thousands of hours saved" at KPMG, reinvested in providing more value to partners and clients. At Qualcomm, workload reductions of 30-40% translated into "happier employees" who are "more productive, more creative, and more satisfied."</p>

                <h4>High Touch: Deepening Customer Relationships</h4>

                <p>When your team has more time, what's the highest-value activity they can do? Build relationships. Whether you're B2B or B2C, creating deeper, more personal connections with customers matters more than ever.</p>

                <p>At Writer, productivity gains from speed and scale get reinvested heavily in field marketing and in-person events. Why? Because AI makes it possible to maintain high-touch human connection at scale. Field marketers use agents to create entire enablement kits for events, but the events themselves remain focused on genuine human interaction.</p>

                <h4>Relevance: Maintaining Your Unique Voice</h4>

                <p>Every interaction needs to be meaningful, with a consistent brand voice showing up on the right channels with the right message. How do AI agents help ensure relevance? By building on your company's unique data and brand rules.</p>

                <p>At Qualcomm, the team uploaded approximately 1,200 trademark and other terms into Writer, providing automatic guidance to marketing teams creating assets. The result? "The assets and materials when they come through tend to be more compliant from the get go," allowing the review team to operate more efficiently while maintaining brand standards.</p>

                <h3>The 1x to 10x Transformation</h3>

                <p>Most marketing teams are stuck in two modes. In the "1x world," they create great assets but then face a slow, painful process of manually translating them for other teams. By the time sales gets the asset, the market conversation has moved on.</p>

                <p>Some teams have graduated to the "5x world," armed with generative AI tools. Things are faster, but teams now spend their days as human APIs, copying and pasting between five different tools. The process remains fragmented, with no governance, and strategic intent gets lost with every new prompt.</p>

                <p>The "10x world" operates differently. As Laura Weaver, Writer's Director of Enterprise Content, explains: "At the moment, I'm orchestrating half a dozen major strategic initiatives. Before Writer, I could probably only keep up with one, maybe two of these at a time."</p>

                <p>The shift requires three strategic questions:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>When starting something new: "How can we design this AI-native from day one?"</li>
                    <li>When fixing a broken process: "Could an agent run this better and free humans for strategic work?"</li>
                    <li>When considering new vendors: "Is this a tool purchase or an AI agent opportunity?"</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>From Personal Productivity to Organizational Capability</h3>

                <p>The real breakthrough comes when individual workflows become organizational assets through playbooks. "The mastery isn't locked in one person's head," Weaver notes. "It's a scalable asset for the entire organization."</p>

                <p>Anyone on the team can execute complex workflows with power-user rigor instantly. Demand gen teams can monitor campaigns and ideate on ad copy in a click. Product marketing teams can conduct deep competitive research and pull market data. Sales teams can automate follow-ups while checking LinkedIn for lead details, all in time for their next call.</p>

                <h3>The Path Forward</h3>

                <blockquote>"The antidote to fear isn't just more tools, it's a new mindset," Lomanto concludes. "It's the shift from being a passive user to an active architect."</blockquote>

                <p>This transformation requires excellent technology built for enterprise reliability and consistency at scale. But more importantly, it requires visionary leadership from people willing to rebuild how work gets done.</p>

                <p>"Brand will become the most valuable competitive edge a company can have," Lomanto predicts. "Standing out from the noise will be crucial. And the only way to do that is by focusing on what makes you you and by building genuine connections with your customers."</p>

                <p>The question isn't whether your organization will adopt AI for marketing. The question is whether you'll use it to race to the bottom or race to the top.</p>

                    <div class="post-content">The marketing pressure cooker is real. 🔥

Board expectations for instant AI transformation. New tools launching daily. And the fear that using the same tech as competitors will make your brand sound generic.

Sound familiar?

Writer CMO Diego Lomanto says there's a better path: the agentic marketing engine.

It's built on 5 pillars:
→ Speed & Scale (productivity gains)
→ Humanity, High Touch & Relevance (brand differentiation)

The breakthrough insight? Don't just use AI to do more. Use it to reclaim time, then reinvest in creativity, strategy, and customer relationships.

Real results:
• KPMG: Thousands of hours saved, reinvested in client value
• American Eagle: 500+ content pieces/week (up from 6 photos/campaign)
• Qualcomm: 30-40% workload reduction = happier, more creative teams

"The real question is no longer about what AI can do for us, but what we as marketers are prepared to do with the freedom that it provides." - Diego Lomanto

                    <h3>Post #2: The Mindset Shift</h3>
                    <div class="post-content">From 1x → 5x → 10x marketing.

Most CMOs I talk to fall into one of three categories:

🐌 1x Marketers: Create great assets, then manually translate them for every team. By the time sales gets it, the market's moved on.

🔧 5x Marketers: Armed with AI tools, things move faster. But teams are now human APIs, copying between 5 different tools. Strategic intent gets lost.

🚀 10x Marketers: AI agents orchestrate entire workflows. One input → dozen downstream tasks, automatically executed.

Laura Weaver, our Director of Enterprise Content, put it perfectly:

"At the moment, I'm orchestrating half a dozen major strategic initiatives. Before Writer, I could probably only keep up with one, maybe two of these at a time."

The shift isn't about more tools. It's about a new mindset.

Three questions for your team:
1. When starting new projects: "How can we design this AI-native from day one?"
2. When fixing broken processes: "Could an agent run this better?"
3. When buying tools: "Is this a tool purchase or an AI agent opportunity?"

"The antidote to fear isn't just more tools, it's a new mindset. It's the shift from being a passive user to an active architect." - Diego Lomanto, Writer CMO

Where does your team fall on the spectrum?

The data doesn't lie. Leading marketing teams are seeing real results:

📊 Qualcomm: 30-40% workload reduction
⚡ KPMG: Hour-long tasks that used to take all day
📈 American Eagle: 500 content pieces/week for 34K SKUs
😊 Qualcomm: "Happier employees are more productive, more creative, and satisfied"

But here's what matters most: they're not just doing more. They're doing better.

The secret? Using AI to reclaim time, then reinvesting in what humans do best:
• Creative strategy
• Customer relationships  
• Brand differentiation
• High-touch experiences

As one KPMG leader shared: "What this adds up to is it allows our team to provide more value to the firm, to our partners, and our clients at the end of the day."

That's the agentic marketing engine in action.

Speed + Scale (productivity) → Humanity + High Touch + Relevance (differentiation)

Your team isn't being replaced. They're being empowered.

                    <div class="body">Hi [First Name],

I came across something that made me think of our conversation about [specific pain point/challenge discussed].

Writer's CMO, Diego Lomanto, recently hosted a webinar called "The Agentic Marketer" that addresses exactly what you mentioned: the pressure to adopt AI without sacrificing brand differentiation.

His main point resonated with me: "The real question is no longer about what AI can do for us, but what we as marketers are prepared to do with the freedom that it provides."

The webinar walks through a five-pillar framework that companies like KPMG, American Eagle, and Qualcomm are using to turn productivity gains into actual brand differentiation. Some highlights:

• KPMG cut deliverable time from all-day to one hour
• American Eagle scaled from 6 campaign photos to 500 content pieces/week
• Qualcomm reduced team workload 30-40% and reinvested in strategic work

I thought the "race to the top vs. race to the bottom" framework might be particularly relevant for [specific initiative/project at prospect's company].

Here's the recording: [WEBINAR LINK]

There's also a starter kit for mapping your high-impact workflows if you want something tactical.

Would love to hear your thoughts after you watch. Does this align with how you're thinking about AI in your team?

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. - The "day in the life" segment showing a Director of Enterprise Content orchestrating 6 strategic initiatives (vs. 1-2 before AI) is worth watching on its own.</div>

                    <div class="subject">Subject: From 1x to 10x marketing – framework for [Company]</div>
                    <div class="body">[First Name],

Quick question: Does your marketing team ever feel like they're caught between two impossible demands?

1. "Use AI to double your output"
2. "But don't let our brand sound like everyone else"

I ask because I just watched Writer's CMO break down exactly how leading marketing teams are solving this paradox.

The insight: most companies are stuck in "5x marketing" – using AI tools but spending their days copying and pasting between 5 different systems. Teams become "human APIs" and strategic intent gets lost.

The breakthrough is moving to "10x marketing" – where AI agents orchestrate entire workflows while humans focus on creativity, strategy, and customer relationships.

Three companies proving it works:

KPMG: Turned day-long deliverables into one-hour tasks, reinvested "thousands of hours" in client value

American Eagle: Handles 34,000 SKUs with AI while maintaining brand voice, saw 250% search lift from AI-enabled campaign

Qualcomm: 30-40% workload reduction = "happier employees who are more productive, more creative, and satisfied"

The webinar lays out a practical framework: Speed + Scale (productivity) → Humanity + High Touch + Relevance (differentiation).

Given what you shared about [specific challenge: team bandwidth/brand consistency/market pressure], I thought this might spark some ideas for [upcoming initiative/Q1 planning].

Watch here: [WEBINAR LINK]

They also provide a starter kit with an activity mapping grid to identify where AI agents could have the biggest impact on your team.

Worth 15 minutes of your time?

                <div class="objection-handler">
                    <h4>Objection: "We're already using AI tools and don't see the ROI yet"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Response:</strong> "That's the classic 5x trap – teams have tools but spend their day copying between systems. The companies seeing real ROI, like KPMG and Qualcomm, shifted from tool usage to workflow orchestration. KPMG turned all-day tasks into one-hour deliverables. The difference? AI agents that orchestrate across their entire marketing stack vs. individual tools used in isolation. Want to see how that architecture looks different?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="objection-handler">
                    <h4>Objection: "Our team is worried AI will replace their jobs"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Response:</strong> "That's actually the biggest risk of NOT adopting this approach. Qualcomm saw 30-40% workload reduction, but instead of cutting headcount, they reinvested in strategic work. Their teams are 'happier, more productive, and more creative' because they're not drowning in repetitive tasks. The agentic model specifically protects human value by freeing people for work only humans can do – the creative strategy, the relationship building, the brand differentiation. Want to see their transformation story?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="objection-handler">
                    <h4>Objection: "We need to maintain brand consistency and governance"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Response:</strong> "That's exactly why companies like Qualcomm chose this approach. They uploaded 1,200 trademark terms and brand rules so every piece of AI-generated content automatically adheres to their standards. The legal team sees more compliant assets from day one. It's not about loosening governance – it's about embedding governance into the AI system itself. How are you handling brand compliance today with your current tools?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="objection-handler">
                    <h4>Objection: "This sounds expensive / complex to implement"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Let me flip that: what's expensive is having your best marketers spend 80% of their time on repetitive coordination. American Eagle went from 6 photos per campaign to 500 content pieces per week without proportionally scaling headcount. The ROI isn't in the platform cost – it's in the time arbitrage. An hour saved at a Director level is worth [calculate]. When Writer's Content Director says she can now orchestrate 6 strategic initiatives vs. 1-2 before, that's the real cost equation. What's your team's time currently allocated to?"</p>
